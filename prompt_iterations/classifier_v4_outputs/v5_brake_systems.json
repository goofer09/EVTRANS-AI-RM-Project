      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Master Cylinder is a component directly tied to the hydraulic braking system in ICE vehicles, which is not used in EVs due to their regenerative braking systems."

      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Brake Booster is fundamentally tied to hydraulic brake systems, which are common in ICE vehicles but not typically found in EVs due to the different power source."
