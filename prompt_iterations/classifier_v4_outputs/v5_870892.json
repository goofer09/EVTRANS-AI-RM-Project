      "component": "Muffler",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Muffler is a component designed to reduce exhaust noise in internal combustion engine vehicles. Electric vehicles do not produce exhaust noises, so mufflers are not necessary."

      "component": "Catalytic Converter",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Catalytic converter is fundamentally tied to combustion engines as it converts harmful exhaust gases from the internal combustion engine into less toxic emissions."

      "component": "Exhaust Manifold",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Exhaust Manifold is fundamentally tied to combustion engines for directing exhaust gases from multiple cylinders to a single pipe before entering the exhaust system."

      "component": "Tailpipe",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "A tailpipe is an integral part of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines (ICE) for the expulsion of exhaust gases."
