        "technical_compatibility": "Differentials are crucial in both ICE and EV vehicles; however, they require adaptations to accommodate the torque characteristics of EVs.",
        "manufacturing_feasibility": "Existing manufacturing facilities can be repurposed with reasonable modifications, but may require some investment in new machinery or processes.",
        "supply_chain_concentration": "There are a few dominant differential manufacturers, which creates potential supply chain risks but also opportunities for consolidation and diversification.",
        "demand_stability": "Demand for differentials in EVs is expected to remain steady as the transition progresses due to the persistent need for drivetrain components.",

        "technical_compatibility": "While axle halfshafts are crucial in ICE vehicles, their direct equivalents may not be necessary in EVs due to different drivetrain designs. However, they can still be relevant in adapting existing platforms for hybrid or parallel-hybrid systems.",
        "manufacturing_feasibility": "Existing manufacturing facilities for axle halfshafts have a high potential for repurposing as the basic production processes and machinery remain similar between ICE and EV drivetrains.",
        "supply_chain_concentration": "The supply chain for axle halfshafts tends to be diversified, with multiple manufacturers producing this component. This diversity helps mitigate potential supply disruptions during the EV transition.",

        "value_added": "Axle halfshafts contribute significant value to vehicles by transmitting torque from the powertrain to the wheels. Their production requires skilled labor and engineering expertise, ensuring a high economic value contribution.",
        "regulatory_exposure": "As axle halfshafts are not directly related to ICE emissions or fuel consumption, they face less exposure to environmental regulations and potential phase-outs associated with ICE vehicles."

Universal joints are relatively simple components compared to others.",
