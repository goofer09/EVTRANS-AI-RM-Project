        "technical_compatibility": "Radiators in EVs are not essential as they are primarily used to cool the engine in ICE vehicles. However, some electric powertrains might require cooling systems for specific components like batteries or motors.",
        "manufacturing_feasibility": "Existing manufacturing processes can be adapted to produce radiators suitable for electric vehicles, given the similarities in size and materials used. The main challenge lies in adjusting the design to accommodate different cooling requirements.",
        "supply_chain_concentration": "The supply chain is moderately diversified as there are multiple manufacturers for radiator cores. However, a decrease in demand for ICE vehicles could impact smaller suppliers more significantly.",
        "demand_stability": "Demand stability is expected to be moderate during the EV transition due to the gradual phase-out of ICE vehicles and increasing adoption of electric vehicles. This change will not occur overnight and will provide time for suppliers to adjust.",
        "value_added": "Radiator cores require skilled labor and a certain level of complexity in their manufacturing process, contributing economic value through employment and production costs.",
        "regulatory_exposure": "Radiator cores are exposed to ICE-related regulatory phase-out due to the focus on reducing emissions from vehicles. As governments continue to implement stricter emission standards, the demand for radiators in ICE vehicles may decrease."
