    {
      "component": "Conventional Hydraulic Shock Absorber",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Conventional hydraulic shock absorbers are mechanical components used to control the suspension system, which is common to both ICE and EV vehicles for maintaining tire contact with the road surface."

    {
      "component": "Gas-pressurized Shock Absorber",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Gas-pressurized shock absorbers are essential for maintaining vehicle suspension and handling, a requirement common to both ICE and EV vehicles."
    },
    {
      "component": "Twin-tube Shock Absorber",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Twin-tube Shock Absorber is essential for maintaining vehicle suspension and stability, which is common across both ICE and EV vehicles."

    {
      "component": "Coilover Shock Absorber",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Coilover shock absorbers are responsible for controlling the spring and suspending weight of a vehicle, irrespective of drivetrain type."

    {
      "component": "Electromagnetic Shock Absorber",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Electromagnetic Shock Absorbers function to dampen the oscillations caused by road surfaces in both ICE and EV vehicles, thus they are required for vehicle operation regardless of drivetrain type."
    },
    {
      "component": "Active Hydraulic Shock Absorber",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Active hydraulic shock absorbers are essential for maintaining vehicle stability and ride comfort, regardless of the type of drivetrain (ICE or EV). They do not rely on combustion engines, fuel systems, exhaust systems, or electric drivetrain-specific mechanisms."
    },
    {
      "component": "Electrostratic Shock Absorber",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Electrostratic Shock Absorbers are components that help maintain vehicle suspension and ensure a comfortable ride for passengers, regardless of whether the vehicle is powered by an ICE or EV drivetrain."
    },
    {
      "component": "Piezoelectric Shock Absorber",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasoning": "Piezoelectric shock absorbers are not fundamentally tied to internal combustion engines (ICE) or electric drivetrains (EV). They function as mechanical components for improving ride comfort and stability in vehicles, regardless of the powertrain."
