    {
      "component": "Gearbox Housing",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Gearbox housing is fundamentally tied to mechanical power transmission of combustion engines."

    {
      "component": "Gear Train",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Gear train is primarily used for transmitting mechanical power in internal combustion engine vehicles to smoothly transition between gears. Electric drivetrains typically do not require mechanical gear shifting."
    },
    {
      "component": "Clutch Assembly",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Clutch assembly is a mechanical component for transmitting power from the engine to the transmission, which is not needed in electric vehicles as they do not have conventional internal combustion engines."
    },
    {
      "component": "Differential",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The differential is a key component in distributing power to the wheels and ensuring proper torque distribution between them, which is required for both ICE and EV vehicles."
