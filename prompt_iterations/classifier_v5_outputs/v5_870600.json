    {
      "component": "Engine",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 1.0,
      "reasoning": "The Engine is fundamentally required for the operation of Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles due to its role in fuel delivery, combustion, and engine-specific mechanics."
    },
    {
      "component": "Transmission",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Although some aspects of the transmission are adapted in electric vehicles (such as the elimination of clutch and multi-speed gearbox for single-speed transmissions), the basic function of transferring power from the engine to the wheels remains unchanged."
    },
    {
      "component": "Suspension System",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Suspension system is a mechanical component that provides vehicle stability and ride comfort during motion, regardless of whether the powertrain is internal combustion engine (ICE) or electric vehicle (EV)."

    {
      "component": "Steering System",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The steering system is a mechanical interface between the driver and vehicle, independent of the powertrain type."
