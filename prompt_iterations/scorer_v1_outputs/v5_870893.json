        "supply_chain_concentration": "There is moderate concentration of suppliers in the market, but diversification efforts are ongoing as demand for EV components increases.",
        "demand_stability": "Demand for Single Mass Flywheels is expected to decrease with the shift towards EVs and may experience instability during the transition period.",
        "value_added": "The skill level required for manufacturing this component is relatively low, and its economic value contribution is limited compared to more complex components such as motors or batteries.",

        "technical_compatibility": "Multi-plate clutches are primarily used in internal combustion engine vehicles. Due to the difference in power delivery between ICE and EVs, they have limited compatibility with electric vehicles.",
        "manufacturing_feasibility": "Existing manufacturing facilities can potentially repurpose some processes for components that share similarities with EV drivetrains (e.g., gearboxes), but the specific nature of multi-plate clutches requires modifications that may not be straightforward.",
        "supply_chain_concentration": "There are several manufacturers of multi-plate clutches, which helps to diversify the supply chain, reducing the risk of over-reliance on a single supplier.",
        "demand_stability": "The demand for multi-plate clutches in ICE vehicles is likely to decline during the EV transition, leading to some level of instability as new markets are sought or existing facilities adapt.",
        "value_added": "Manufacturing multi-plate clutches involves intermediate levels of complexity and skill, but they contribute less economic value compared to more critical components such as batteries or electric motors in EVs.",
        "regulatory_exposure": "Given the environmental impact associated with internal combustion engines, multi-plate clutches face significant regulatory exposure as countries phase out ICE vehicles and transition towards electric alternatives."

        "supply_chain_concentration": "The supply chain for this component is likely concentrated due to its specialized nature and low volume production compared to more common automotive parts.",
        "demand_stability": "During the transition from ICE to EVs, demand for manual transmission components such as the Clutch Pedal Assembly may decline, but there will still be a need for them in certain vehicle applications.",
