      "reasoning": {
        "technical_compatibility": "Clutch assemblies are primarily used in conventional Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles. For electric vehicles (EVs), the role of clutches is minimized due to the use of single-speed transmissions or no transmissions at all. Therefore, their compatibility decreases.",
        "manufacturing_feasibility": "Although not a primary component in EVs, clutch assembly manufacturing can be adapted for certain hybrid vehicles. The existing manufacturing processes and technologies may allow for a smooth transition with potential modifications to the design or production lines.",
        "supply_chain_concentration": "The supply chain for clutch assemblies is concentrated due to the high demand in ICE vehicles. This concentration can potentially be leveraged during the transition phase, enabling easier sourcing and scaling up of production if needed.",
        "demand_stability": "As the shift towards EVs accelerates, the demand for clutch assemblies will decrease significantly. This instability can lead to challenges in maintaining a stable market and steady demand for the component.",
        "value_added": "The value-added potential of clutch assemblies is limited due to their role being primarily mechanical and not contributing significantly to advancements or innovation within the automotive industry, particularly in EVs.",
        "regulatory_exposure": "Regulations aimed at promoting cleaner and more efficient vehicles may increase the demand for EVs and reduce demand for ICE vehicles. This could potentially impact the clutch assembly market, as it is primarily used in ICE vehicles."
