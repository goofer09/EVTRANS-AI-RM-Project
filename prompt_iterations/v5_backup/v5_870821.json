    "prompt": "You are an automotive engineering expert.\nFor HS Code 870821 (Safety Seat Belts), identify the TOP 4 most critical **physical sub-components** of the braking system. Exclude driver interface components (pedal assembly), sensors, or any non-essential parts. Focus only on parts directly responsible for stopping the vehicle.\n\nUse **consistent component terminology** across all outputs (e.g., always 'Brake Pads', never 'Brake Pads/Shoes'). Ensure **subsystems are clearly labeled** and distinct (Wheel Brake System vs Hydraulic Brake System).\n\nExamples of critical sub-components: brake pads, brake calipers, brake master cylinder, brake booster, brake discs.\n\nReturn ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations):\n[\n  {\"name\": \"Component 1\", \"function\": \"Primary function\", \"subsystem\": \"Subsystem\"},\n  {\"name\": \"Component 2\", \"function\": \"Primary function\", \"subsystem\": \"Subsystem\"},\n  {\"name\": \"Component 3\", \"function\": \"Primary function\", \"subsystem\": \"Subsystem\"},\n  {\"name\": \"Component 4\", \"function\": \"Primary function\", \"subsystem\": \"Subsystem\"}\n]\n\nRequirements:\n- Exactly 4 components\n- Use precise engineering terms\n- Focus on **combustion-engine vehicles**\n- Avoid any parts that are not essential for brake operation\n- Functions must be concise and clear",
