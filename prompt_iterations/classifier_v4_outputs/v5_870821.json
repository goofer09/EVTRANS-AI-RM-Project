      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The retractor is a component typically associated with seatbelts in ICE vehicles, which are not part of the electric vehicle's design as they do not have an internal combustion engine."

      "reasoning": "Pretensioners are primarily used to tighten seat belts during an impact in a collision. They operate mechanically and are not directly related to electric drivetrains."
