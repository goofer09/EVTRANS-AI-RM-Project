    {
      "component": "Rack and Pinion Steering Gear",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Rack and Pinion Steering Gear is a mechanical system for converting rotational motion from the steering wheel to the road wheels; it's required in both ICE and EV vehicles."

      "component": "Steering Column",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The steering column is a fundamental mechanical component required for directional control in both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles."

    {
      "component": "Tie Rods",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Tie rods are a suspension component that maintains directional stability in both internal combustion engine (ICE) and electric vehicles (EV), as they link the steering system to the wheels."

      "component": "Center Link",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "The Center Link is a suspension component that serves the same purpose in both ICE and EV vehicles, connecting and controlling the movement of wheels."
