      "component": "Axle Assembly",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The axle assembly in both ICE and EV vehicles serves the function of transmitting torque to the wheels, remaining essential for propulsion."

      "component": "Differential",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The differential is a mechanical component that connects and drives the left and right wheels differently. It's essential in both Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) and Electric Vehicle (EV) vehicles for proper traction control."

    {
      "component": "Transmission",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The transmission component is required to control the rotational speed of the drivetrain in both ICE and EV vehicles."

      "component": "Engine Mount",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Engine mount serves as a support for the internal combustion engine (ICE), but is also used in electric vehicles (EVs) to secure other components such as battery pack or electric motor."
