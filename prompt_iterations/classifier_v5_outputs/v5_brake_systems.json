    {
      "component": "Brake Calipers",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Brake calipers are essential for deceleration in both ICE and EV vehicles, as they convert the kinetic energy of the vehicle into thermal energy through friction."
    },
    {
      "component": "Master Cylinder",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The master cylinder is a hydraulic component in braking systems which does not depend on internal combustion processes or electric drivetrain architecture for its operation."
    },
    {
      "component": "Brake Booster",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Brake booster operates based on hydraulics and pressure, independent of the powertrain type."
    },
    {
      "component": "Brake Disc or Drum",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Brake disc or drum is a fundamental safety component for vehicle stopping and does not rely on internal combustion processes or electric drivetrain architecture."
