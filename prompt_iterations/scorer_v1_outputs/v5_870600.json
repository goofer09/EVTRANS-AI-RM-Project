        "technical_compatibility": "EVs do not require a transmission in the traditional sense. This component is largely obsolete in electric vehicle architecture.",
        "manufacturing_feasibility": "While some components may have applications in motor control or power management, the overall manufacturing feasibility is limited due to the diminishing relevance of this part in EVs.",
        "supply_chain_concentration": "There are several suppliers for transmissions in ICE vehicles. However, during the transition, many will likely pivot towards more relevant electric powertrain components.",
        "demand_stability": "The demand for traditional transmissions is expected to decrease steadily over time as EV adoption increases.",
        "value_added": "Transmissions are complex mechanical systems that require a high level of skill and economic value to manufacture. However, their relevance in the EV transition will diminish significantly.",
        "regulatory_exposure": "Given the focus on reducing emissions from vehicles, components like transmissions contribute to CO2 emissions and may face increased regulatory scrutiny during phase-outs of ICE vehicles."
