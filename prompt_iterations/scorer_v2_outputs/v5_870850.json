        "technical_compatibility": "Constant Velocity Joints (CVJs) are primarily used to transmit power in internal combustion engine vehicles. They will not be needed in EVs as they don't have a drivetrain with multiple shaft angles.",
        "manufacturing_feasibility": "Existing manufacturing equipment can potentially be repurposed for some aspects of CVJ production, but significant modifications may be required due to the different materials and requirements for EV components.",
        "supply_chain_concentration": "The supply chain for CVJs is relatively concentrated as they are used in a wide range of ICE vehicles. This concentration may persist for some time during the transition, but will likely decrease over time with reduced demand.",
        "demand_stability": "Demand for CVJs is expected to decrease significantly due to the phase-out of internal combustion engine vehicles. Stability is low as their replacement by EV drivetrain components is inevitable.",
        "value_added": "CVJ production requires a moderate level of skill and complexity, but its economic value is not as high compared to more critical vehicle components like batteries or motors in the context of the EV transition.",
        "regulatory_exposure": "As CVJs are ICE-specific components, they are exposed to the phase-out regulations aimed at promoting the adoption of electric vehicles. Their demand and relevance will decrease as these regulations are implemented."
