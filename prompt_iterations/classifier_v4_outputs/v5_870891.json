    {
      "component": "Radiator Core",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Radiator core cools the engine fluid (coolant) to prevent overheating of the internal combustion engine. Electric vehicles do not have this need due to their power electronics being air-cooled."

    {
      "component": "Radiator Tank",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Radiator tank is used to cool down the engine and related components in ICE vehicles. In EVs, with no internal combustion engine, it's not required."
    },
    {
      "component": "Radiator Fan",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Radiator fan is fundamentally tied to combustion engines for cooling purposes, as EVs rely on electric motors that don't generate heat like internal combustion engines."
    },
    {
      "component": "Radiator Cap",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Radiator cap is fundamentally tied to cooling systems of combustion engines for managing heat generated during the fuel combustion process."
