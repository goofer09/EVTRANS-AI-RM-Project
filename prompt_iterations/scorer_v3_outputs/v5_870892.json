        "technical_compatibility": "Not applicable in EVs as they do not require a muffler for internal combustion engine noise reduction.",

        "supply_chain_concentration": "Dominated by a few key players in the market, ensuring a relatively stable supply chain.",
        "demand_stability": "Demand for mufflers will likely decrease with the increase of EV adoption and stricter noise regulations.",
        "value_added": "No significant value-addition as it primarily serves to reduce noise emissions which may not be an issue in electric vehicles.",
        "regulatory_exposure": "Potential exposure due to tighter noise emission regulations for EVs, but existing technology and manufacturing methods could still meet these standards."

        "manufacturing_feasibility": "High as catalytic converter manufacturing process is well established and adaptable for small adjustments, such as material changes.",
        "supply_chain_concentration": "High due to the limited number of suppliers worldwide, making it easier to manage during a transition.",
        "demand_stability": "Medium as some demand may still exist for hybrid vehicles and certain market segments.",
