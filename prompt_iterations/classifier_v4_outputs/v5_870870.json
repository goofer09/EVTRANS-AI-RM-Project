    {
      "component": "Axle Assembly",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Axle assembly provides structural support and transmits power from the drivetrain to the wheels, which is a fundamental function for both ICE and EV vehicles."
    },
    {
      "component": "Engine Mount",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Engine mount is a mechanical component that secures the internal combustion engine to the vehicle's chassis or frame. In electric vehicles, this component is not needed because they do not have an internal combustion engine."
    },
    {
      "component": "Transmission Assembly",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Transmission Assembly is fundamentally tied to the mechanical operation of internal combustion engines (ICE), as it controls power delivery and torque conversion. In electric vehicles (EVs), the power electronics and motor provide continuous power and torque directly without requiring a transmission."
    },
    {
      "component": "Differential Assembly",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "The differential assembly is a mechanical component used to distribute power from the drive wheels to the driving axle, and it's crucial for vehicle stability during turns. It remains necessary in both ICE and EV vehicles."
