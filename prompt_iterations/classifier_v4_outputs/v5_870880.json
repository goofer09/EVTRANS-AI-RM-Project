    {
      "component": "Piston Rod",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Piston Rod is a mechanical component directly connected to the reciprocating motion of pistons in internal combustion engines, which does not apply to electric vehicles."
    },
    {
      "component": "Shock Piston",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Shock piston is a fundamental component of the suspension system, required for vehicle stability and ride comfort, which remains consistent in both ICE and EV vehicles."
    },
    {
      "component": "Damper Tube",
      "classification": "ICE_ONLY",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasoning": "Damper tube is a component related to the suspension system which absorbs and dampens shocks generated by road surfaces. It's not directly linked with electric drivetrains as they don't produce mechanical vibrations comparable to ICE vehicles."
    },
    {
      "component": "Mounting Bracket",
      "classification": "SHARED",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "reasoning": "Mounting brackets are required for securing various vehicle components, regardless of drivetrain type."
