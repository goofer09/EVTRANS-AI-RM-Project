      "reasoning": {
        "technical_compatibility": "Brake boosters are still needed in hybrid and mild-hybrid vehicles, but their significance decreases in full electric vehicles as regenerative braking takes over. However, for safety reasons, some form of mechanical braking system will likely remain.",
        "manufacturing_feasibility": "Manufacturing processes for brake boosters are well established and can be easily adapted to meet the requirements of both ICE and EV vehicles, with only minor modifications.",
        "supply_chain_concentration": "The supply chain for brake boosters is concentrated among a few major players. As the shift towards electrification continues, diversifying the supply chain will be crucial to ensure continuity and reduce potential bottlenecks.",
        "demand_stability": "Demand for brake boosters in ICE vehicles will gradually decrease as the EV market share increases. However, the demand for safety-related components like brakes is likely to remain stable overall, just with a shift towards EV applications.",
        "value_added": "Value added by brake boosters in an EV system is limited compared to an ICE vehicle due to the reduced need for mechanical force amplification. However, their importance for safety and potential for integration with regenerative braking systems could increase their value-added over time.",
        "regulatory_exposure": "Regulations may require backup braking systems in EVs, potentially increasing demand for components like brake boosters. On the other hand, efforts towards reducing vehicle weight and improving efficiency might lead to pressure on manufacturers to reduce component size or find alternatives."

        "demand_stability": "Demand for brake discs and drums may experience fluctuations due to the transition to EVs, as braking systems in EVs are different from those in ICE vehicles, potentially impacting demand for traditional components.",
        "value_added": "The value-added aspect lies in the high wear rate of brake components, ensuring continued need for replacements even during the EV transition.",
